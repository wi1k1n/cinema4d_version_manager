* Show which instances are currently running
* Means to sort tags (e.g. via context menu)
* Autosave layout (+ device(monitor) to open it on right device)
* Tags attribute: group default folded (to fold tag group by default)

* [+] Grouping - Single layer (at least for now)
	* [+] Search paths
	* [+] Tags
	* [+] Major versions
	* ~~Package/installer (? same as search paths?)~~
	* [-] New installations

* Filtering - with negation
	* Search string
	* plus Same as grouping

* Sorting
	* By version (major, complex?)
	* By date (creation date)
	* Tags custom order / alphabetically / by number of tags

Grouping Filtering Sorting (GFS) should inherit preset concept (one can save these settings as presets for quickly applying GFS settings)
