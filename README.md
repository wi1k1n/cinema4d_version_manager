### TODOs:
* [○] C4D instances interaction:
	* [✔] Show which c4d instances status on tiles: currently running, closed
	* [✔] Allow to activate, kill, restart c4d instances
		* [ ] Activate window (virtual desktops?)
	* [ ] Enable/Disable actions depending on current state (no restart before running)
	* [✔] Extend grouping to group by state: running, killed, closed, not started
	* [ ] Kill all action
* [○] Group/Filter/Sort
	* [○] Create layout
	* [ ] Add functionality to the layout
	* [✔] Adjust appearing behavior (executing action should toggle tag/filter window state, rather than always openning it)
* [○] Tag window improvements
	* [ ] Space bar pressed while dragging applies tag but doesn't break dragging
	* [✔] Means to sort tags (e.g. via context menu)
	* [ ] default folded/unfolded group when grouping by tags
	* [ ] tags customization opportunities:
		* [ ] tag contains arguments to run c4d with
		* [ ] tag contains sheets of arguments that are injected into context menu
		* [ ] can be custom scripts to run before running c4d (overkill!)
	* [✔] group to the tag in the tag manager (change grouping to "group by tag", + fold all except selected tag)
* [ ] Auto saving options
	* [ ] Store last selected group/filter/sort settings
	* [ ] Store last layout (tags & filter/sort window states)
	* [ ] Store device where the window is positioned
* [○] Preferences
	* [✔] layouts and layout behavior
	* [✔] saving/loading preferences
	* [✔] functionality: app behavior reflects settings
	* [ ] prepare a list of c4d that are in cache but not found on system anymore
	* [ ] Register global shortcut to open window from background
		* [ ] Hide on lost focus checkbox in preferences (have doubts it'd be convenient, may be worth testing)
	* ~~[ ] custom regex instead of "trim c4d version"~~
	* [✔] Add "Nothing found, change search paths and Rescan (Ctrl + F5)" label if no cinema was found
* [ ] Regular Tiles view
	* [ ] Show string from build.txt
	* [✔] double click on empty space -> default grouping (set default in preferences)
	* [ ] try saving scrollbar position, such that after updatetiles it stays where it was
	* [ ] Revisit modifiers with clicks -> unify UX-wise
	* [ ] Small triangle sign on top-right corner of each tile, showing that c4d is installed
* [ ] Tiles desktop view
	* [ ] A separate tab with draggable c4d tiles that work with search, but doesn't have any grouping options
* [✔] Shortcuts window in 'Help' section
* [ ] Change gitlab to github logo, + private -> public access
* [ ] Ctrl+Shift+B -> BugsLife -> Open issues on github/gitlab
* [ ] Ctrl+O -> add search path and open preferences
* [ ] Esc -> Close shortcuts window

### Bugs:
* Color picker for tags is behind edit window
* Inconsistent disabling entries in preferences on load
* Normalize slashes in paths

### Group/Filter/Sort research
* [+] Grouping - Single layer (at least for now)
	* [+] Search paths
	* [+] Tags
	* [+] Major versions
	* ~~Package/installer (? same as search paths?)~~
	* [-] New installations

* Filtering - with negation
	* Search string
	* plus Same as grouping

* Sorting
	* By version (major, complex?)
	* By date (creation date)
	* Tags custom order / alphabetically / by number of tags

Grouping Filtering Sorting (GFS) should inherit preset concept (one can save these settings as presets for quickly applying GFS settings)
