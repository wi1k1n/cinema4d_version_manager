	* Allow to activate, kill, restart c4d instances

* Register global shortcut to open window from background
	* Hide on lost focus checkbox in preferences

### Bugs:
	* Normalize slashes in paths


* Done ~~Means to sort tags (e.g. via context menu)~~

### Group/Filter/Sort research
* [+] Grouping - Single layer (at least for now)
	* [+] Search paths
	* [+] Tags
	* [+] Major versions
	* ~~Package/installer (? same as search paths?)~~
	* [-] New installations

* Filtering - with negation
	* Search string
	* plus Same as grouping

* Sorting
	* By version (major, complex?)
	* By date (creation date)
	* Tags custom order / alphabetically / by number of tags

Grouping Filtering Sorting (GFS) should inherit preset concept (one can save these settings as presets for quickly applying GFS settings)
