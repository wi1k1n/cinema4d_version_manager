### TODOs:
* Show which instances are currently running
* Means to sort tags (e.g. via context menu)


* Grouping - Single layer (at least for now)
	* Search paths
	* Tags
	* Major versions
	* Package/installer (? same as search paths?)
* Filtering - with negation
	* Search string
	* + Same as grouping
* Sorting
	* By version (major, complex?)
	* By date (creation date)
	* Tags custom order / alphabetically / by number of tags

Grouping Filtering Sorting (GFS) should inherit preset concept (one can save these settings as presets for quickly applying GFS settings)
